					<h3>Stuff I've been doing recently</h3>
					<p>For the past 6-8 months, in addition to a site-wide upgrade, I've been working hard on a new system for CyberGamer. This new system is inspired by facebook and has the purpose of connecting friends in real-time when they're online. The system features a multi-purpose toolbar, but most importantly a friends list and an activity list.</p>
					<p>Using Node.js - which is a platform built on Google's V8 javascript engine - I'm able to keep a constant connection open with all users on CyberGamer through longpolling, and am able to push data to specific users as events happen. This means users are notified when their friends come online or go offline, they can send real-time instant messages to their friends with negligible latency and can see what their friends are up to through the activity listing.

					<h3>I'm a gamer too.</h3>
					<p>When I'm not coding, I'm pwning. At the moment I'm playing Starcraft 2, and the betas of Valve's DOTA 2 &amp; CS:GO. When I'm not actively playing a game, you can usually find me watching the GSL (Global Starcraft League) with Tasteless and Artosis.</p>
					<p>Prior to this, I played Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2 competitively in Australia and am still active competing in small tournaments for these two games each year.</p>
					<p>Away from my PC, I am a bit of a Nintendo nut. I love the Zelda franchise (like most) and have finished the latest adventure in the series <em>Skyward Sword</em>. I also own a 3DS, DSi, N64 and an NES. Yes I missed out on an SNES :(</p>
